# Add-Assembler-Batteries
A factorio mod that allows you to build batteries in Assembly Machines as well as in Chemical Plants

I produced this mod because I find it annoying to have to 'criss cross' my factories when building robots.

In the vanilla game, batteries are made in chemical plants which I usually build in an oil-processing area, and the robot-frames are made in assembling machines which I tend to keep on my production bus. The robot-frames need batteries.

I visualise chemical plants as places where a chemical reaction is required to produce something. I also think that in the real-world, batteries are closer to being 'assembled' rather than made with a 'chemical reaction' in a plant.

This mod does not stop batteries from being made in chemical plants, it just adds the ability to make them in assembly machines.

# How it works
A recipe is added to the vanilla game so that batteries can be made in assembly machines.

The research tree is amended so that when batteries are available in chemical plants, they are also available in assembly machines.
